# ThinkSmart View Voice Terminal Image

[中文](README.md) | English

> Fork customizations: [persistent navigation, Wi-Fi entry, ARM64 media launchers and optional gateway patches (Chinese)](docs/customizations.md). Source changes only, not a newly built flashable image. No personal configuration, credentials or music-source scripts are included.

## Deploying this fork to another device

Only another **CD-18781Y** is in scope, not other ThinkSmart/ARM models. This fork currently has no image Release: flash a verified upstream base image, then install this branch's customizations. A source ZIP is not flashable.

- [New-device guide (Chinese)](docs/new-device-guide.md)
- [Per-device acceptance checklist](docs/device-checklist.md)
- [Maintenance and recovery](docs/maintenance-and-recovery.md)
- [Prerequisites for publishing an integrated image](docs/image-release-readiness.md)

The retained guide below describes the upstream base image, not a ready-made customized image from this fork. Never clone another device's stock eMMC, persist, SSH host keys or complete userdata archive.

Turn a Lenovo **ThinkSmart View (model CD-18781Y)** into a local voice assistant: it boots straight into the voice interface, wakes up on "小麦小麦" (*Xiǎo Mài Xiǎo Mài*), and can talk to Claude, DeepSeek and many other large language models.

The image is based on [rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart](https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart) (Ubuntu 24.04 + postmarketOS kernel 6.19), without the Plasma desktop, and comes with:

- the voice client [xiaozhi-thinksmart-client](https://github.com/justhalfbit/xiaozhi-thinksmart-client): wake word, conversation screen, sleep hours, brightness, online updates;
- the Xiaozhi hub [xiaozhi-hub-server](https://github.com/justhalfbit/xiaozhi-hub-server): on-device speech recognition, connects to LLM and text-to-speech providers, with a web admin page;
- device fixes: both microphones, the speaker, screen blanking and proximity wake, Wi-Fi stability, GPU white-screen/freeze patches and more.

The interface and the wake word are Chinese for now.

> ⚠️ Flashing wipes the original Teams / Android system. Before the first flash, **back up the whole eMMC** ([A2](#a2-back-up-the-whole-stock-emmc-required)). It is the only way back to the stock system later.

This README is the complete flashing guide, written so that a person or an AI agent can follow it step by step.

## For AI agents (read this first)

If you are an AI agent the owner asked to help with flashing, read this whole section before starting at step 0.

### Goal

Start with the [new-device guide](docs/new-device-guide.md): verify the target model, its own backup and the upstream base image, then follow the flashing instructions below. Install this fork's customizations only after the base system works. This fork has no customized image Release; never flash its source ZIP or another device's private image.

### Overall flow

```
Step 0  Preparation: check the model → install edl → download and verify the files
Step 1  Enter EDL mode → edl printgpt → pick a route by the size of the system partition
  Route A (stock system): full backup → lk2nd to boot → bootstrap to system → boot
                          → SSH into the bootstrap, rewrite the partition table → power off → EDL again → this image to system
  Route B (already Ubuntu): (optional) back up user data → EDL → this image to system
Step 2  First boot: Wi-Fi on the screen → find the IP → hub admin password and API key → change both account passwords → try voice
```

### Operations that need the owner's explicit yes first

Each of these is irreversible or wipes data. Before running one, tell the owner **the exact command** and **what it does**, and wait for a clear "yes / go ahead / do it". One yes covers that one step only; ask again for the next.

| Step | Operation | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A2 | The full-backup target file already exists | The old backup is overwritten and gone. By default use another file name instead |
| A3 | `edl w boot lk2nd.img` | The stock boot chain is replaced by lk2nd; Android/Teams will no longer boot |
| A4 | `edl w system bootstrap…img` | The stock `system` partition is overwritten |
| A6 | Running `apply-ubuntu-gpt.sh` in the bootstrap | The whole partition table is rewritten; the stock vendor, cache, userdata and other partitions are deleted |
| A8 / B3 | `edl w system thinksmart-ubuntu-…img` | Everything on `system` is overwritten (including chat history, API keys and Wi-Fi settings of the old system) |
| — | Any `edl wf` (write back the whole disk) | The entire eMMC is overwritten. Only when the owner explicitly asks to return to stock |

Also stop and ask when:

- the output of any step doesn't match the "expected output" in this guide;
- a write command has failed once. You may explain and suggest one retry; if it fails again, stop. Don't keep retrying.

### Things the owner must do by hand

An AI agent can't do these. At these points tell the owner exactly what to do and wait until they say it's done:

- plug and unplug the USB cable and the power cable, try another cable or another USB port on the computer;
- the button combination for EDL mode (unplug the power cable → connect the USB cable → hold Volume + and Volume − → plug in the power cable → release the volume buttons after 3–5 seconds; see 1.1);
- powering off and on: the device has **no power button**; plugging in the power cable turns it on. While the system is running, shut it down before unplugging: tap 「关机」 (Shut down) at the bottom of the voice interface's settings, or run `sudo systemctl halt` over SSH, and unplug 10 seconds after the screen goes black (the system takes a few more seconds to finish). Wait about 30 seconds before plugging it back in; plugged straight back in, it may not power on. The 「关机」 button comes with client 0.1.2; the image ships 0.1.0, so update it first under 「软件更新」 (Software update) in the settings. Don't use `sudo poweroff`: with the cable in, the device powers straight back on. Only unplug without shutting down when you can't (emergency mode, the lk2nd screen);
- look at the device screen and tell you what it shows (black, lk2nd screen, welcome page, voice interface…);
- pick the Wi-Fi network and type its password on the device's touchscreen;
- open the hub admin page in a browser, set the admin password, enter the API key;
- say "小麦小麦" to the device to confirm voice works;
- click "Allow" when macOS asks "Allow accessory to connect?", and "Yes" on a Windows UAC prompt.

### Never do these on your own

- Don't use `edl w` on any partition other than `boot` and `system`; don't use `edl e` (erase), `edl wl`, `edl qfp` or other bulk-write commands.
- Don't flash or erase with fastboot: no `fastboot flash`, `fastboot erase` or `fastboot oem unlock`. The bootloader is locked, fastboot can't write anything, and trying only causes trouble.
- Don't run `apply-ubuntu-gpt.sh` again on a device whose partition table was already rewritten, and don't run `sfdisk`, `dd` or `parted` on `/dev/mmcblk0` yourself.
- Don't delete, move or overwrite the stock full backup `stock-full-emmc.bin`, and never upload it anywhere. It holds data unique to this device (serial numbers, calibration data, accounts from the stock system).
- Don't write the owner's Wi-Fi password, API key or device passwords into logs or repositories, or send them to any third-party service.
- Don't modify downloaded image files. If a checksum doesn't match, download again.
- Never ask the owner to unplug or power off during a write.

### Working rules

- For each step run the "command", then compare with the "expected output" and "how to tell it worked". Move on only when they match; otherwise see "if it fails", and if that doesn't solve it, stop and ask the owner.
- Save the full output of every `edl` command (`2>&1 | tee LOGFILE`) to show the owner if something goes wrong.
- **Find the device's IP yourself; don't ask the owner**: work out the subnet from the computer's own IP, scan the LAN with `nmap -p 22,16688 --open <subnet, e.g. 192.168.1.0/24>`, then open `http://<IP>:16688/admin` and check that the page title is 「小智 Hub 管理后台」 (Xiaozhi Hub admin). Exact commands, and what to do without nmap, are in [2.3](#23-find-the-devices-ip-address).
- Commands assume a macOS / Linux terminal. On Windows use PowerShell: after setting up `edl` as in [0.2 Windows](#windows-1011-untested), copy `edl` commands as they are; for the others use this table:

  | macOS / Linux | Windows PowerShell |
  | --- | --- |
  | `shasum -a 256 FILE` | `Get-FileHash FILE -Algorithm SHA256` |
  | `ls -l FILE` | `(Get-Item FILE).Length` |
  | `grep TEXT FILE` | `Select-String TEXT FILE` |
  | `python3` | `python` |
  | `ping -c 3 ADDRESS` | `ping -n 3 ADDRESS` |
  | `xz -dk FILE.xz` | unpack with 7-Zip |
  | `… 2>&1 \| tee LOG` | same (in PowerShell `tee` is `Tee-Object`) |

- The Windows parts were **not tested** by this project; they follow edl's and upstream's documentation and are marked "Windows untested". If things don't match, the easiest fix is to flash from a macOS or Linux computer instead.
- The owner already runs this image and just wants a newer one? Go to [Route B](#route-b-device-already-runs-this-image-or-the-upstream-ubuntu-image), but still do steps 0 and 1 first.

---

## 0. Preparation

### 0.1 Check the device model

Only the **Lenovo ThinkSmart View CD-18781Y** is supported: 8-inch portrait screen, Qualcomm APQ8053, 2 GB RAM, 8 GB eMMC.

- The label on the back or bottom of the device says **CD-18781Y**.
- After entering EDL (step 1), the output of `edl printgpt` contains `CPU detected: "APQ8053"` and `total_blocks:15269888`. If either differs, **this is not the right device: stop**.
- Devices with a model number other than CD-18781Y (including the ThinkSmart View Plus) were not tested; don't flash them.

### 0.2 Computer and tools

You need:

- a macOS, Linux or Windows computer with **at least 20 GB free** (stock full backup about 7.3 GB, bootstrap image about 1 GB, this image about 0.7 GB compressed and 3.5 GB unpacked);
- a USB cable **that carries data** (USB-C on the device side), plugged straight into the computer, not through a dock or hub;
- [bkerler/edl](https://github.com/bkerler/edl), the Qualcomm EDL flashing tool; install commands per system below;
- a tool for `.xz` files and an SSH client (macOS, Linux and Windows 10/11 all come with SSH).

#### macOS

```bash
brew install libusb xz git
python3 -m venv ~/edl-venv
source ~/edl-venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/bkerler/edl.git ~/edl-src
cd ~/edl-src && git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install .
```

In every new terminal, run `source ~/edl-venv/bin/activate` first so that the `edl` command is available.

If `pip install .` fails on the newest Python, use Python 3.12: `brew install python@3.12`, replace `python3 -m venv` above with `python3.12 -m venv`, and run the steps again.

#### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install git xz-utils python3-venv python3-dev liblzma-dev libusb-1.0-0
sudo systemctl disable --now ModemManager    # ModemManager grabs the EDL device
git clone https://github.com/bkerler/edl.git ~/edl-src
cd ~/edl-src && git submodule update --init --recursive
sudo bash ./install-linux-edl-drivers.sh     # udev rules, so normal users can access the EDL device
python3 -m venv ~/edl-venv
source ~/edl-venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

Unplug and replug the USB cable after installing the udev rules. If it still says permission denied, put `sudo` in front and use the full venv path: `sudo ~/edl-venv/bin/edl …`.

#### Windows 10/11 (untested)

The upstream author flashed from Windows (upstream FLASHING.md uses PowerShell commands). This project has not tested Windows; the steps below are put together from edl's source and documentation.

Don't use edl's one-click script `install_edl_win10_win11.ps1` as it is. It installs Python 3.9 while edl needs 3.10 or newer, and the `edl.bat` it puts on PATH calls a file that no longer exists in edl 3.62, so typing `edl` fails with "file not found". Use these manual steps instead, in PowerShell (not CMD):

```powershell
winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12
winget install -e --id Git.Git
winget install -e --id akeo.ie.Zadig
winget install -e --id 7zip.7zip
```

Close PowerShell, open it again, then:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bkerler/edl.git $env:USERPROFILE\edl-src
cd $env:USERPROFILE\edl-src
git submodule update --init --recursive
py -3.12 -m venv $env:USERPROFILE\edl-venv
& $env:USERPROFILE\edl-venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In every new PowerShell window, run these two lines first. After that the `edl …` commands in this guide work as written:

```powershell
& $env:USERPROFILE\edl-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
function edl { python "$env:USERPROFILE\edl-src\edl.py" @args }
```

If `Activate.ps1` says running scripts is disabled, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` first (applies to the current window only).

USB driver: the first time the device is in EDL (step 1.1), install the WinUSB driver for it with Zadig so that edl can reach it. edl ships the Windows libusb library itself; nothing else to install.

Why not WSL: WSL2 doesn't see USB devices by default and needs usbipd-win to pass them through; the EDL device reconnects during flashing and the pass-through drops easily. Running edl natively on Windows is more reliable.

#### Check that edl works

```bash
edl --help
```

Expected: the output starts with `Qualcomm Sahara / Firehose Client`, followed by a long usage text. If `edl` is not found: on macOS / Linux run `source ~/edl-venv/bin/activate` first; on Windows run the two "every new PowerShell window" lines above.

### 0.3 Download the files

Create a working directory such as `~/thinksmart` and put all the files below in it. All later commands run in this directory.

| File | Where | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img.xz`, `SHA256SUMS` | compatible upstream base image from [Releases](https://github.com/justhalfbit/thinksmart-ubuntu-image/releases), checked against the [new-device guide](docs/new-device-guide.md); not an integrated image from this fork | both routes |
| `lk2nd.img` | upstream [prebuilt/lk2nd.img](https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/raw/main/prebuilt/lk2nd.img) | route A only |
| `bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img` and its `.sha256` | upstream release [bootstrap-2026-05-22](https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/releases/tag/bootstrap-2026-05-22) | route A only |

No separate partition table files are needed: the bootstrap image already contains the GPT rewrite script `/usr/local/sbin/apply-ubuntu-gpt.sh` and its layout file.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/thinksmart && cd ~/thinksmart
curl -L -O https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/raw/main/prebuilt/lk2nd.img
curl -L -O https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/releases/download/bootstrap-2026-05-22/bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img
curl -L -O https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/releases/download/bootstrap-2026-05-22/bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img.sha256
# This image: copy the download links of the two files of the latest release from the Releases page, and download them with curl -L -O as well
```

In Windows PowerShell write `curl` as `curl.exe`; everything else stays the same. If GitHub is blocked or slow where you are, add a proxy to curl with `-x http://PROXY:PORT`, or download in a browser and move the files into this directory.

### 0.4 Verify the files

```bash
cd ~/thinksmart
shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS          # on Linux sha256sum works too
shasum -a 256 bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img lk2nd.img
cat bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img.sha256
```

Expected output:

- the first command prints `thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img.xz: OK`;
- the bootstrap image's SHA256 equals the value in the `.sha256` file: `7d79db19b0911647bf6ab0a9a2924ef5cf83b4674798a54acdcbd41cdf07921b`;
- the SHA256 of `lk2nd.img` is `c81b036c75028c3d5aa915c72c89e075bc044360fe964c2ec0afb1d4a6f5209b`. That is upstream's version at the time of writing; if upstream updates lk2nd later, upstream wins.

On Windows compute each one with `Get-FileHash .\FILENAME -Algorithm SHA256` and compare with the values above.

If any of them doesn't match, download that file again; don't use it.

### 0.5 Unpack the image

```bash
xz -dk thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img.xz
shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS
```

Expected: two lines, `.img.xz: OK` and `.img: OK`. The unpacked `.img` is about 3.5 GB (`3466592256` bytes for version 20261101, `711307968` bytes compressed; later versions in the release notes). On Windows unpack with 7-Zip, then compare `Get-FileHash` with the `.img` line in `SHA256SUMS`.

The `.img` is the content of the whole `system` partition and holds two small partitions, boot and root. On first boot the root partition grows to fill the whole `system` partition.

---

## 1. Enter EDL mode and pick a route

### 1.1 Enter EDL (owner does this)

The device has no power button: plugging in the power cable turns it on, unplugging it cuts the power.

1. Unplug the power cable. If the system is running, shut it down first (「关机」 in the settings or `sudo systemctl halt`) and unplug 10 seconds after the screen goes black. If the USB cable is plugged in, unplug it too. Then wait 30 seconds before the next steps; plugged straight back in after a shutdown, it may not power on and won't enter EDL.
2. Connect the device to the computer with the USB cable.
3. **Hold Volume + and Volume − together** and keep holding.
4. While holding them, plug in the power cable.
5. Release the volume buttons after 3–5 seconds.

**The screen stays black; that's normal.** EDL mode shows nothing.

Check that the computer sees the device:

- macOS: `ioreg -p IOUSB | grep -i -E "qhsusb|qusb|9008"` should show `QUSB__BULK` or `QHSUSB__BULK`. On Apple Silicon Macs, click "Allow" when asked "Allow accessory to connect?".
- Linux: `lsusb | grep -i 9008` should show `Qualcomm ... (QDL mode)` or `05c6:9008`.
- Windows (untested): Device Manager shows `QUSB__BULK` (usually with a yellow exclamation mark) or `Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008`. **The first time**, install the WinUSB driver: open Zadig → menu Options, tick List All Devices → pick `QUSB__BULK` in the drop-down (USB ID `05C6 9008`) → choose `WinUSB` as the driver on the right → click Install Driver (it says Replace Driver if another driver is installed). Once is enough.

Not there? See [3.1 edl can't find the device](#31-edl-cant-find-the-device-or-loses-it-right-after-connecting).

### 1.2 Read the partition table

```bash
cd ~/thinksmart
edl printgpt 2>&1 | tee gpt-before.txt
```

Expected output (excerpt):

```
main - Device detected :)
...
CPU detected:      "APQ8053"
...
firehose - TargetName=MSM8953
firehose - total_blocks:15269888
...
boot:                Offset 0x0000000018200000, Length 0x0000000002000000, ...
system:              Offset 0x000000001c300000, Length 0x…, ...
```

How to tell it worked: `Device detected :)` appears and a partition list is printed. If `CPU detected` isn't `APQ8053` or `total_blocks` isn't `15269888`: **stop, this device is not supported**.

### 1.3 Pick a route

Look at the `Length` on the `system:` line:

| `system` Length | `userdata:` line? | Meaning | Route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0000000060000000` (1.5 GB) | yes | stock partition table | [Route A](#route-a-first-flash-device-still-on-the-stock-system) |
| `0x00000001b3cfbe00` (about 6.8 GB) | no | already the Ubuntu partition table | [Route B](#route-b-device-already-runs-this-image-or-the-upstream-ubuntu-image) |
| anything else | — | unknown partition table | **stop**, show the output to the owner, don't continue |

---

## Route A: first flash (device still on the stock system)

Exactly the same order as upstream:

```
full backup → lk2nd to boot → bootstrap to system → boot the bootstrap
→ SSH in and rewrite the partition table → power off → EDL again → this image to system
```

Why the detour: the stock `system` partition is only 1.5 GB, too small for Ubuntu. A small temporary system (the bootstrap, postmarketOS) is flashed first and rewrites the partition table on the device to a layout with a `system` of about 6.8 GB; then the real image goes in.

### A1. Enter EDL

As in [1.1](#11-enter-edl-owner-does-this). If you just finished step 1 and the cable hasn't been unplugged, carry on directly.

### A2. Back up the whole stock eMMC (required)

This is the **only way** back to the stock system later.

```bash
cd ~/thinksmart
ls -l stock-full-emmc.bin 2>/dev/null && echo "a backup file already exists: use another name, don't overwrite it"
edl rf stock-full-emmc.bin 2>&1 | tee backup.log
```

- Takes about 10–20 minutes; don't touch the cable.
- Expected: the output ends with `Dumped flash with sector count 15269888 as stock-full-emmc.bin.`

Check that the backup is complete; all three must hold:

```bash
ls -l stock-full-emmc.bin
python3 -c "f=open('stock-full-emmc.bin','rb'); f.seek(512); print(f.read(8))"
shasum -a 256 stock-full-emmc.bin | tee stock-full-emmc.bin.sha256
```

1. The file is exactly `7818182656` bytes, i.e. `15269888 × 512`;
2. the second command prints `b'EFI PART'`: the backup starts with a complete GPT;
3. the third saves the checksum in `stock-full-emmc.bin.sha256`, to check later that the backup is still intact.

(Windows: `(Get-Item .\stock-full-emmc.bin).Length` for the size, the `python -c …` line as is, `Get-FileHash` for the checksum.)

Where to keep it:

- in `~/thinksmart` together with `gpt-before.txt`, **plus a copy on an external drive or another computer**;
- not in cloud storage or anywhere public: it contains data unique to this device.

To go back to stock later: in EDL run `edl wf stock-full-emmc.bin` to write the whole disk back, only with the owner's yes.

If it fails:

- Error or disconnect midway: unplug, enter EDL again, try another cable or port, run it again (with another file name).
- Wrong size or no `EFI PART`: the backup is incomplete; delete it and redo it. **Don't go further until the backup is done.**

### A3. Flash lk2nd to the boot partition (ask the owner first)

lk2nd is a secondary bootloader that boots Linux from the `system` partition.

```bash
edl w boot lk2nd.img 2>&1 | tee flash-lk2nd.log
```

Expected: the output ends with `Wrote lk2nd.img to sector 790528.`

If it fails:

- `Couldn't detect partition: boot`: the partition table wasn't read correctly; run `edl printgpt` again and look.
- Any other error: enter EDL again and retry once; if it still fails, stop.

### A4. Flash the bootstrap image to the system partition (ask the owner first)

```bash
edl w system bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img 2>&1 | tee flash-bootstrap.log
edl reset
```

Expected output:

- the first command ends with `Wrote bootstrap-pmos-ssh-generic-qcom-msm8953.img to sector 923648.`
- `edl reset` prints `Reset succeeded.`

The device reboots by itself: the lk2nd screen appears briefly, then postmarketOS starts. **Leave the USB cable in**; the next step uses it for SSH.

### A5. Log in to the bootstrap over SSH

Once booted, the bootstrap provides a network over the USB cable: the device is `172.16.42.1`, and the computer normally gets `172.16.42.2` automatically.

1. Wait 1–2 minutes for the device to finish booting.
2. Check that the computer has a new network interface:
   - macOS: a new wired interface in "System Settings → Network";
   - Linux: a new `usb0` or `enx…` interface in `ip -br addr`;
   - Windows (untested): a new Ethernet adapter in "Network Connections". The bootstrap uses a USB NCM network adapter; Windows 11 has an NCM driver built in and usually recognizes it, while the NCM driver built into Windows 10 is incompatible with some devices and may not. If it isn't recognized, see "Windows can't use the USB network" below.
3. If the interface didn't get a `172.16.42.x` address, set it manually: IP `172.16.42.2`, subnet mask `255.255.0.0`, router empty.
4. Log in (password `thinksmart`):

```bash
ping -c 3 172.16.42.1
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new pmos@172.16.42.1
```

After logging in, check that it's the right system:

```bash
cat /etc/hostname
ls /usr/local/sbin/apply-ubuntu-gpt.sh
```

Expected: `thinksmarter`, and the script path itself.

If it fails:

- No ping reply: check on the screen that postmarketOS is up; try another USB port; on macOS set the IP manually as in point 3; unplug and replug the USB cable.
- The screen stays on lk2nd (it says fastboot): the bootstrap wasn't flashed correctly; go back to A1, enter EDL, redo A4.
- Windows can't use the USB network (untested): use Wi-Fi instead. As upstream does on Windows, use upstream's script `sources/scripts/prepare-pmos-ssh-bootstrap-image.sh` in WSL to write the Wi-Fi name and password into the bootstrap image (usage in Stage 0 of upstream [FLASHING.md](https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart/blob/main/FLASHING.md)), go back to A1 and redo A4 with this new image, then after boot find the IP of host `thinksmarter` in the router and `ssh pmos@<IP>`. Or borrow a macOS or Linux computer for this one step.

### A6. Rewrite the partition table (ask the owner first, irreversible)

In the SSH session on the bootstrap, run:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/apply-ubuntu-gpt.sh
```

If `sudo` asks for a password, it's `thinksmart` too. Expected end of the output:

```
GPT rewrite complete.
Next steps:
1. Power off or reboot the device.
...
```

Step 3 of the script's message names upstream's image file; **ignore it**, the next step flashes this image.

Then power off right away:

```bash
sudo poweroff
```

This grows `system` to about 6.8 GB, deletes the stock vendor, cache, userdata and other partitions, and moves `persist` to the end of the disk.

If it fails: if the script reports an error, **don't power off and don't retry**; give the full output to the owner and stop.

### A7. Enter EDL again and check the new partition table

Wait until the screen goes black (with the cable in it may light up again by itself; that's fine), then unplug the power and enter EDL as in [1.1](#11-enter-edl-owner-does-this), then:

```bash
edl printgpt 2>&1 | tee gpt-after.txt
grep -E "^(system|userdata):" gpt-after.txt
```

Expected: a single `system:` line with `Length 0x00000001b3cfbe00`, and no `userdata:`.

If `system` is still `0x0000000060000000`: the partition table wasn't rewritten; go back to A4 (lk2nd is already in place, no need to redo A3).

### A8. Flash this image (ask the owner first)

```bash
edl w system thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img 2>&1 | tee flash-system.log
edl reset
```

- Writing takes from a few minutes to twenty; don't touch the cable.
- Expected: the output ends with `Wrote thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img to sector 923648.`, then `Reset succeeded.`

If it fails:

- `Error: … has N sectors but partition only has 3145728.`: the partition table is still stock; go back to A7 and check.
- Error halfway through: enter EDL again and retry once; if it still fails, stop and give `flash-system.log` to the owner.

When done, unplug the USB cable and go to [step 2: first boot](#2-first-boot-and-setup).

---

## Route B: device already runs this image or the upstream Ubuntu image

The partition table and lk2nd are already in place; only the `system` partition is rewritten.

> This wipes everything on the old system: chat history, the hub's API keys and admin password, Wi-Fi settings, SSH authorizations. To update just the voice client or the hub, **no reflash is needed**; see [section 5](#5-updates).

### B1. (Recommended) Back up user data first

If the old system is this image and you want to keep chat history and settings, back up as in [4.1](#41-back-up-before-flashing) and restore after flashing. If it's upstream's Plasma image, skip this; it has none of this data.

### B2. Enter EDL and check the partition table

Do [1.1](#11-enter-edl-owner-does-this) and [1.2](#12-read-the-partition-table), and check that the `system` Length is `0x00000001b3cfbe00`.

### B3. Flash this image (ask the owner first)

Exactly the same as [A8](#a8-flash-this-image-ask-the-owner-first):

```bash
edl w system thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img 2>&1 | tee flash-system.log
edl reset
```

Unplug the USB cable and go to step 2.

---

## 2. First boot and setup

### 2.1 First boot

- The first boot is slower, about 1–2 minutes: the system grows the root partition to fill the whole `system` partition and generates this device's own SSH host keys. Later boots take about 20 seconds.
- The screen shows the **welcome page** (dark background, with the device address and Wi-Fi status).

### 2.2 Connect Wi-Fi on the screen (owner does this)

1. On the welcome page tap the 「连接 Wi‑Fi」 (Connect Wi-Fi) button, then tap your network in the 「选择 Wi‑Fi」 (Choose Wi-Fi) list.
2. Type the password with the on-screen keyboard and tap 「连接」 (Connect). 「已连接 …」 (Connected …) means it worked.
3. Once connected, the bottom of the welcome page shows 「设备地址」 (device address), and a few seconds later the screen switches to the voice assistant.

Can't connect? See [3.3](#33-no-wi-fi-or-wi-fi-setup-on-the-screen-fails).

### 2.3 Find the device's IP address

You need it for the browser and SSH. The flashed system currently **can't be reached over a USB cable** (see the [appendix](#usb-network-after-flashing)); use its Wi-Fi address once it's on Wi-Fi.

AI agents: **find it yourself; don't ask the owner**.

1. Find the computer's subnet (the computer must be on the same router as the device):

   ```bash
   # macOS: prints this computer's IP
   ipconfig getifaddr $(route -n get default | awk '/interface:/{print $2}')
   # Linux: the address after src is this computer's IP
   ip -4 route get 1.1.1.1
   ```

   If this computer's IP is `192.168.1.23`, the subnet is usually `192.168.1.0/24`.

2. Scan the LAN for a machine with both port 22 (SSH) and 16688 (hub admin page) open:

   ```bash
   nmap -p 22,16688 --open 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

   No nmap: `brew install nmap` on macOS, `sudo apt install nmap` on Linux. If 16688 doesn't show up, the hub may still be loading its speech recognition model; wait a minute and scan again.

3. Confirm a candidate: open `http://<IP>:16688/admin`; if the page title is 「小智 Hub 管理后台」 (Xiaozhi Hub admin), it's the device. From the command line:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://<IP>:16688/admin | grep -o '<title>[^<]*'
   ```

If nmap finds nothing on macOS, or `curl` / `ssh` says `No route to host`: the terminal app lacks the "Local Network" permission; see [3.8](#38-ssh-says-no-route-to-host-on-macos).

Without nmap (works on Windows too; on Windows use `ipconfig` to see this computer's IP):

- the DHCP client list (device list) in your router's admin page; the host name is `thinksmarter`;
- the device screen: 「设备地址」 (device address) on the welcome page (after connecting to Wi-Fi the screen switches to the voice assistant almost at once, so it only flashes by), or 「本机 IP」 (Device IP) in the voice interface's settings page. For this one, ask the owner to read the screen to you.

Below, `<DEVICE_IP>` stands for this address.

Before the first SSH: if this IP was used by another device or the old system before, clear the old entry first, or SSH will complain that the host key changed:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <DEVICE_IP>
```

If you use the dedicated known-hosts file from section 4.2, clear it there too: `ssh-keygen -R <DEVICE_IP> -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts_thinksmart`.

### 2.4 Hub admin page: set the admin password, enter an API key (owner does this)

1. Open `http://<DEVICE_IP>:16688/admin` in a browser on the computer. After boot the hub needs about a minute to load its speech recognition model; if the page doesn't open, wait and reload.
2. **Set the admin password first.** Until then, anyone on the same network can open this page.
3. Enter the API key of your LLM provider. Claude API is the default; DeepSeek and other providers can be chosen in the admin page.
4. Save.

Without a key, the assistant wakes up but can't answer.

AI agents: the owner types the API key into the browser. Don't enter it for them, and don't write the key into any file or log.

### 2.5 Change the default passwords (do it right after flashing)

As upstream, the image has two accounts that can log in, **both with the default password `thinksmart`, both reachable over SSH**:

| Account | Default password | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ubuntu` | `thinksmart` | everyday account, passwordless sudo |
| `root` | `thinksmart` | administrator, **SSH also allows root to log in with a password** |

Anyone on the same network who knows the default password can log in to the device, so change both passwords; changing only `ubuntu` is not enough:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<DEVICE_IP>
passwd               # change ubuntu's password
sudo passwd root     # change root's password
```

If you don't need remote root logins, you can lock root's password instead (`sudo passwd -l root`) and use `ubuntu` with `sudo` when you need administrator rights.

If you have SSH'd to this device before (including `172.16.42.1` during the bootstrap), its host key has changed; clear the old entries first:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <DEVICE_IP>
ssh-keygen -R 172.16.42.1
```

AI agents: the owner types the new passwords themselves. Don't make one up for them and don't record it.

### 2.6 Check that voice works (owner does this)

1. Say "**小麦小麦**" (*Xiǎo Mài Xiǎo Mài*; it also answers to 「哈喽小麦」 *Hā lou Xiǎo Mài* and 「小麦同学」 *Xiǎo Mài tóng xué*) to the device. The screen switches to listening and a prompt sound plays.
2. Ask something, for example 「今天星期几」 ("what day is it today"), and wait for the answer.

If it doesn't respond, check the services over SSH:

```bash
systemctl status thinksmart-client --no-pager | head -5    # voice client, should be active (running)
systemctl --user status xiaozhi-hub --no-pager | head -5   # hub, should be active (running)
journalctl -u thinksmart-client -b --no-pager | tail -30
```

Wakes up but can't answer: most likely the API key is missing or wrong; go back to 2.4. Doesn't wake up or no sound: see [3.4](#34-no-sound-or-no-reaction-to-the-wake-word).

---

## 3. Troubleshooting

### 3.1 edl can't find the device, or loses it right after connecting

Symptom: it stays at `Waiting for the device`, or reports `Couldn't detect the device`.

Try in this order:

1. Make sure the device really is in EDL: black screen, and the computer shows `9008` / `QUSB__BULK` (see 1.1).
2. Use another cable **that carries data**. Many cables only charge.
3. Plug straight into the computer, not a dock, hub or monitor port.
4. Unplug both the USB cable and the power cable to cut the power, then enter EDL again as in 1.1. EDL often needs re-entering after sitting idle for a while or after a failed command.
5. Linux: make sure ModemManager is stopped (`systemctl status ModemManager`) and the udev rules are installed; otherwise use `sudo`.
6. Windows (untested): if the device still has an exclamation mark in Device Manager, install WinUSB with Zadig as in 1.1. If Qualcomm's own 9008 driver is installed, edl can also use the serial port with `--serial` (`edl --serial printgpt`).
7. Apple Silicon Mac: make sure you clicked "Allow" for the accessory.

### 3.2 Boot stops at lk2nd's Fastboot screen

Symptom: the screen shows lk2nd's text menu with `Fastboot mode` and doesn't boot further.

Cause: lk2nd found nothing bootable on the `system` partition. Usually an interrupted write, the wrong file, or an image flashed before the partition table was rewritten.

What to do:

1. Unplug the power cable (you can't log in while it's stuck on lk2nd, so just unplug), then enter EDL as in 1.1.
2. Check with `edl printgpt` that `system` is `0x00000001b3cfbe00`.
3. Verify the `.img` again (section 0.5), then redo A8 / B3.

**Don't flash anything with fastboot.**

### 3.3 No Wi-Fi, or Wi-Fi setup on the screen fails

- The welcome page lists nearby networks. If yours isn't there, check that the router broadcasts normally on 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz (a hidden SSID has to be typed in).
- Right password but stuck at 「正在获取网络地址」 (getting a network address): wait a minute; if it doesn't help, reboot the device once.
- The flashed system currently can't be reached over a USB cable (see the [appendix](#usb-network-after-flashing)). If Wi-Fi setup on the screen keeps failing: reboot the device and try again; if that doesn't help, reflash (A8 / B3) and set up Wi-Fi again.
- When you can already SSH in over Wi-Fi and want to switch to another network, connect from the command line:

  ```bash
  nmcli dev wifi list
  sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "WIFI_NAME" password "WIFI_PASSWORD"
  ip -4 -br addr show wlan0
  ```

  The text interface `sudo nmtui` works too.
- Connected but the screen still shows the welcome page: `sudo kiosk-mode restart` restarts the screen interface.

### 3.4 No sound, or no reaction to the wake word

```bash
systemctl --user status pipewire wireplumber thinksmart-mic --no-pager | grep -E "●|Active"
wpctl status | sed -n '/Audio/,/Video/p'
wpctl get-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@
```

- All three services should be `active (running)`. In `wpctl status`, Sinks should list `Built-in Audio Speaker`, and Sources `Microphone` and `Microphones (both)`.
- Too quiet: `wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 0.5`, or use the device's volume buttons.
- The device's microphone switch (privacy switch) must be on; while it's off the assistant can't hear you.
- Services fine but still no sound: reboot the device. Its audio DSP occasionally gets stuck, and only a reboot brings it back.
- **Don't touch the sound card hardware directly** (`speaker-test -D hw:…`, `aplay -D hw:…` and the like): it can lock up the audio DSP. All sound goes through PipeWire.

### 3.5 The screen never reaches the interface (black, white, or stuck on the welcome page)

```bash
systemctl status thinksmart-kiosk thinksmart-client --no-pager | grep -E "●|Active"
journalctl -u thinksmart-kiosk -b --no-pager | tail -30
```

- `thinksmart-kiosk` is the screen interface, `thinksmart-client` the voice client (which serves the interface).
- Restart the screen interface: `sudo kiosk-mode restart`.
- Stuck on the welcome page: the device isn't online or the voice client didn't start; see 3.3 and the `thinksmart-client` status above.
- Black screen but SSH works: the screen may have blanked; touch it or wave a hand in front of the device.
- SSH doesn't work either: the flashed system can't be reached over USB, so check that the device is on Wi-Fi (3.3) and that you have the right IP (2.3); for `No route to host` on macOS see 3.8; if nothing helps, reflash (A8 / B3).

### 3.6 SSH says the host key changed

```
WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
```

Every flash generates new host keys, so this is expected:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R <DEVICE_IP>
ssh-keygen -R 172.16.42.1
```

If you see this warning **without** having reflashed, don't connect yet; check whether another device took over that IP.

### 3.7 Writing fails because the partition is too small

`Error: … has N sectors but partition only has 3145728.`: the partition table is still stock. Take route A and rewrite the partition table first.

### 3.8 ssh says No route to host on macOS

```
ssh: connect to host <DEVICE_IP> port 22: No route to host
```

The device is online and the IP is right, but the Mac can't reach LAN addresses: most likely the terminal app lacks the "Local Network" permission. Open "System Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network", turn it on for the terminal app you use (Terminal, iTerm, VS Code…), then reopen the terminal and try again. If the browser can't open `http://<DEVICE_IP>:16688/admin`, it may be the same cause; turn the permission on for the browser.

### 3.9 Boot stops in emergency mode

What you see: a screen of text ending with `You are in emergency mode`, with `Failed to start systemd-fsck…` and `Dependency failed for boot.mount - /boot` above it, and further up `I/O error, dev mmcblk0 … (WRITE)`.

Why: the power was pulled without shutting down, the next boot had to repair the boot partition `/boot`, and writing the repair failed. Your data is on another partition (root) and is normally fine. Shutting down before unplugging (see [Things the owner must do by hand](#things-the-owner-must-do-by-hand)) avoids it.

Fix (rewrites only the boot partition, your data stays):

1. Enter EDL as in 1.1.
2. Read the whole `system` partition out first as a backup (about 6.8 GB; about 4 minutes here, up to 15 or so on a slower computer; don't touch the cable meanwhile):

   ```bash
   edl r system system-backup.img
   ```

3. Take the boot partition out of the image of **the version you flashed** (it starts at sector 2048 and is 509952 sectors long):

   ```bash
   dd if=thinksmart-ubuntu-<date>.img of=boot-part.img bs=512 skip=2048 count=509952
   ```

   On Windows run it in WSL.
4. Work out where to write it: the Offset of `system` in `edl printgpt` (for example `0x000000001c300000`) divided by 512, plus 2048. On a device whose partition table was changed as in this guide that is `923648 + 2048 = 925696`.
5. Write it (**ask the user first**) and restart:

   ```bash
   edl ws 925696 boot-part.img
   edl reset
   ```

   It should come up in the voice interface. If it still stops in emergency mode, keep a photo of the screen and `system-backup.img`, reflash with route B and restore your data as in 4.2 (without an earlier backup, the data can be recovered from `system-backup.img`).

---

## 4. Back up and restore user data

> Complete userdata restoration is for the same device after reflashing, not cross-device cloning. Provision another device with its own identity, host keys and network settings; see the [new-device guide](docs/new-device-guide.md).

The image ships with no personal data. When reflashing from an older version of this image to a newer one, you can back these up first and restore them afterwards:

- the hub's data directory: API keys, admin password, Grok login, chat history `chat.db`;
- the Claude Code login (if installed);
- voice client settings: device ID, sleep hours, brightness, screen blanking;
- the screen interface's browser storage;
- `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`;
- Wi-Fi settings, host name, `/etc/thinksmart-kiosk.conf`;
- SSH host keys (optional; restoring them means computers won't warn about a changed host key).

These files contain API keys and passwords. Keep the backup on your own computer only; don't upload it.

### 4.1 Back up before flashing

On the computer, while the old system is still running and reachable over SSH:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<DEVICE_IP> 'systemctl --user stop xiaozhi-hub; cd / && sudo tar --numeric-owner --ignore-failed-read -cpf - \
  home/ubuntu/xiaozhi-hub-server/main/xiaozhi-server/data home/ubuntu/.claude home/ubuntu/.claude.json \
  home/ubuntu/.config/thinksmart-client home/ubuntu/.local/share/thinksmart-kiosk home/ubuntu/.ssh \
  etc/NetworkManager/system-connections etc/netplan etc/thinksmart-kiosk.conf etc/hostname \
  etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key \
  etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub; \
  systemctl --user start xiaozhi-hub' > userdata.tar
chmod 600 userdata.tar
tar tf userdata.tar | head -20
```

- The hub is stopped while packing so the chat database isn't caught mid-write; it starts again afterwards.
- Paths that don't exist are skipped with a one-line notice; the result is still fine.
- The last command should list paths such as `home/ubuntu/xiaozhi-hub-server/...` and `etc/NetworkManager/...`.

### 4.2 Restore after flashing

Prerequisites: flashed, Wi-Fi connected on the screen, `<DEVICE_IP>` known. The restore script is `image/restore-userdata.sh` in this repository and runs on macOS / Linux (on Windows use WSL).

1. Create a dedicated SSH key and authorize it on the device (asks once for `ubuntu`'s password, `thinksmart` right after flashing):

   ```bash
   [ -f ~/.ssh/thinksmart_ed25519 ] || ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f ~/.ssh/thinksmart_ed25519
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/thinksmart_ed25519 -o UserKnownHostsFile=~/.ssh/known_hosts_thinksmart ubuntu@<DEVICE_IP>
   ```

2. Restore:

   ```bash
   TS_HOST=<DEVICE_IP> image/restore-userdata.sh userdata.tar --host-keys
   ```

   - `--host-keys` also restores the old SSH host keys; leave it out if you don't want that. With it, the key recorded in step 1 is the new one and has to go: `ssh-keygen -R <DEVICE_IP> -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts_thinksmart`.
   - If step 1 warns that the host key changed (you connected to this IP before), run that `ssh-keygen -R` first, then redo step 1.
   - Expected output: first `restoring: …`, at the end `restored on the device` and `done; the hub needs about a minute to load its speech model`.
   - The script first unpacks the whole backup into a temporary directory on the device, and only when that fully succeeds stops the services and replaces files; if any step fails it exits with an error, the device stays as it was, and the services are started again.

3. After restoring, the hub's admin password and API keys are back as they were in the backup. Device passwords aren't in the backup; change them again as in 2.5.

---

## 5. Updates

- **Voice client**: check under 「软件更新」 (software update) in the settings page and tap 「更新」 (update) when a new version is available. Updates are downloaded over HTTPS only, the size and sha256 of every file are checked before installing, and a broken install rolls back to the old version automatically.

  To publish client updates yourself (for example of your own modified client): generate the update manifest and packages with `update/make-release.py` from this repository, upload the files to a Release of your own GitHub repository, and change `SOURCES` in `/etc/thinksmart-update.conf` on the device to your repository's Release address. No keys are needed. Updates aren't signed, so whatever the update address serves is installed as root: put only addresses you control or trust in `SOURCES`, **never a public GitHub download mirror or proxy site**. Usage in `update/README.md`.
- **Hub**: in the hub admin page (`http://<DEVICE_IP>:16688/admin`), click 「更新网关」 (update hub) in the sidebar. The page shows the time and short commit hash of the current version and can check for a new one; it only installs when you click update, and a failed update rolls back automatically.

  From the command line instead, after SSH-ing into the device:

  ```bash
  cd ~/xiaozhi-hub-server && bash scripts/update.sh
  ```

  It pulls the new code, installs missing dependencies and restarts the hub.
- **System packages**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` works as usual. The 41 packages the screen, sound and network depend on (patched Mesa, WebKitGTK, Weston, PipeWire, NetworkManager and others; list in `image/held-packages.txt`) are held at the tested versions and won't be upgraded. The kernel and drivers aren't managed by apt and don't change either.
- **The system image itself**: when a new image is released, reflash with [Route B](#route-b-device-already-runs-this-image-or-the-upstream-ubuntu-image), after a [4.1 backup](#41-back-up-before-flashing).

---

## Appendix: partitions and image layout

Background for people and AI agents who want to understand how it works.

| Partition | Purpose | Written by this guide? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `boot` | lk2nd secondary bootloader | once, in route A |
| `system` | the whole Linux system, about 6.8 GB after the rewrite (starts at sector 923648, 14280671 sectors) | on every flash |
| `modem`, `dsp`, `persist` and others | Qualcomm firmware and device data | never |

The image (`.img`) is the content of the `system` partition and contains its own small MBR partition table:

- partition 1: `pmOS_boot` (ext2): kernel, initramfs, device tree, boot configuration;
- partition 2: `pmOS_root` (ext4): the Ubuntu 24.04 root file system. On first boot the initramfs grows it to the end of the `system` partition.

Boot order: Qualcomm PBL → stock SBL/aboot → lk2nd in the `boot` partition → extlinux configuration in `pmOS_boot` on `system` → Linux.

### USB network after flashing

**Known issue: the flashed system currently can't be reached over a USB cable.** The image's USB network is already set to NCM (device `172.16.42.1`; upstream's device package defaults to RNDIS, which macOS doesn't support), but once the system is up the device's USB port isn't recognized by the computer (it doesn't show up in the computer's USB device list), and switching back to RNDIS doesn't change that: the USB port doesn't come up in device mode. Not fixed yet.

So after flashing, connect the device to Wi-Fi and log in over its Wi-Fi address. The USB network during the bootstrap ([A5](#a5-log-in-to-the-bootstrap-over-ssh)) is not affected and works as described.

### System changes in this image

Compared with the upstream image, besides dropping the Plasma desktop and booting straight into the voice interface, these changes were made (all on purpose):

- No pinch zoom on the screen: the screen interface only takes the first finger, so a stray touch can't zoom the page.
- The USB network is set to NCM instead of upstream's RNDIS (though for now the flashed system's USB port isn't recognized by computers, see the previous section).
- Wi-Fi power save off: this QCA9379 adapter misses DHCP replies in power save, so after a boot it took 1–3 minutes to get an IP.
- 41 key packages held at their versions (see [section 5](#5-updates)).
- The proximity sensor is read directly from `/dev/i2c-0` (`ubuntu` is in the `i2c` group) instead of calling sudo every second and flooding the logs.
- Time sync uses NTP servers reachable from China: `ntp.aliyun.com`, `ntp.tencent.com`, `cn.pool.ntp.org`, with `ntp.ubuntu.com` as fallback. The time zone is Beijing time; outside China set your own, for example `sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Berlin`.
- Logs live only in the systemd journal (persistent, at most 64 MB and one month); rsyslog, which wrote a second copy to `/var/log`, is off. Read logs with `journalctl`.
- No crash dumps (core dumps), to save disk space; zram compressed memory is on.
- ModemManager, avahi and udisks2, which aren't needed, are disabled.

Known limitations:

- Wi-Fi can be set up on the screen without a network on first boot; speech recognition runs on the device, while the LLM and text-to-speech (Edge TTS by default) need the internet.
- The camera doesn't work (upstream is still researching it).
- The flashed system can't be reached over a USB cable, only over Wi-Fi (see [USB network after flashing](#usb-network-after-flashing)).
- To block pinch zoom the screen only takes the first finger. When typing fast on the on-screen keyboard with two alternating fingers, a second finger that lands before the first one lifts is dropped, losing a character. Type Wi-Fi passwords slowly, one finger at a time.
- The GPU, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth firmware in the image come from the same sources as upstream's (following upstream).

- The device port, lk2nd, the bootstrap image and the partitioning scheme come from [rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart](https://github.com/rickx/ubuntu-thinksmart); this project wouldn't exist without it. Upstream in turn credits FelixKa's postmarketOS device package and TAS5782M driver, and the postmarketOS project's kernel.
- The flashing tool is [bkerler/edl](https://github.com/bkerler/edl).
- The image is built from Ubuntu 24.04 packages. This is a personal project, not affiliated with Canonical, Lenovo or Qualcomm. "Ubuntu" and "ThinkSmart" are trademarks of their respective owners.
- Flashing is risky and can leave the device unable to boot. Make the full backup first; you do this at your own risk.
